Program: Venom Exploit Builder
Version: 1.0
Language: Visual Basic .NET
.NET Framework: 4.8

Overview:
    Venom Exploit Builder is a program that aims to bypass SmartScreen filters by embedding download
    instructions into files such as...

        LNK --- Windows Shortcut
        HTA --- HTML Application
        VBS --- Visual Basic script
        BAT --- Windows Batchfile
        CMD --- Windows Command script

    Once the command is executed, the payload is downloaded into the Temporary Files directory and
    executed. Each file-type supports a download request using with various Powershell invokations
    or via the system BitsAdmin command.

Note: BitsAdmin can be finickey and requires a filename/extension in the URL. 
        Bad URL: http://www.example.com/files/myscript
        OK URL: http://www.example.com/files/myscript.exe

Updates:
    In the future I will add updates to this, including using CertUtil (Windows Certificate Utility)
    as a third delivery method to download files. I'll also do my best to keep each payload FUD and
    uneffected by SmartScreen filters.
